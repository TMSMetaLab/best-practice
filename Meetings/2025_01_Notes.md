# TMSMultiLab Meeting #1 Jan 2025

## Notes from the meeting:

### 1. Presentation
[Nicholas Holmes](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/TheHandLab) presented a [15-min slideshow](https://github.com/TMSMultiLab/TMSMultiLab/blob/main/Meetings/2025_01_31_TMSMultiLab_Intro.pptx) about the background to TMSMultiLab.

### 2. Discussion
Then there was a 25-minute discussion about what TMSMultiLab could achieve and how it could go about achieving it. Brief notes are:

[Justin Andrushko](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/jandrushko) suggested how to determine motor thresholds was worth discussing.

[Elizabeth Michael](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/emichael15) asked about how we go beyond M1 to use thresholds from motor cortex on other areas; and as an aside, why are we using 50 uV as an EMG baseline

[Nicholas Holmes](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/TheHandLab) noted that there is a large [EMG Consensus](https://github.com/TMSMultiLab/TMSMultiLab/wiki/EMG) group who may be able to help here - perhaps a future talk from one of them?

[Phivos Phylactou](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/phivph) has looked at (meta-)relationships between [M1 and V1 thresholds](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pnpbp.2024.111020) - there is a correlation, but the real problem is finding an independent measure of cotico-spinal excibility to validate the TMS-dervied thresholds agains.

[Roisin McMackin](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/RMcM-Physiol) raised the method of 'hotspot' determination as a good thing to work on, particularly when no neuronavigation is available - what methods should we use? Also noted there's not much transparency in the literature on what and how to do it. Further points raised include methods for how we filter and process our EMG levels and baseline noise. Has been using threshold-tracking methods to set TMS intensities, and that may be good for some populations like healthy controls, but not all protocols will transfer to other domains. How many pulses of TMS should we use, and other statistical-power questions.

[Friedericke Breuer](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/F-Breuer) noted that teaching students is challenging, so combining guidance on what and how to teach, which things to focus on; we need consensus on training (some [training guidance](https://github.com/TMSMultiLab/TMSMultiLab/wiki/Training) already exsts)

[Katherine Dyke](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/katdyke) pointed out that different institutions will all have guidance for what counts as 'being trained for TMS' - for ethical approval too - so this would be a good thing to combine forces on. Here is the UK/EU/World-approved training guidance for different people and uses. Later, Kat raised several problems around paired-pulse studies - how do we set the intensity of the test pulse - using a fixed proportion of the motor threshold (eg 120%), or a fixed level of MEP amplitude (eg 1mV). This is not resolved. Likewise, how do we adjust the intensity of the test pulse for different conditions within the same experimental protocol - to give a constant output, or to vary as a function of the other conditions. A number of motor protocols seem to depend on TMS intensity...

Gesa Hartwigsen pointed out that most of the discussion and guidance is on motor cortex studies, but many people want to study higher-level (cortical) processes, so how do we translate motor consensus to cognitive domains? In particular: what do we expect from a specific protocol on cognitive domains? there is controversy over whether someting is 'inhibitory' or 'facilitatory', and we don't really have a way to assess this. The TACS challenge is trying to reach consensus on a single protocol, and it's taking a long time. Could we choose a well-used cognitive task as a model for how TMS protocols are supposed to work?
	
Marta Bortoletto underlined that reaching consensus on basic methods is good, but also we need to know whether or how these methods may actually relate to the study outcomes that we are interested in. how does the RMT, for example, affect the results of the cognitive study?

### 3. TMS Rerpoting Checklist
An ongoing project by [Szekely](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/OrsolyaSzekely) & [Holmes](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/people/TheHandLab) is looking at how to rate the [Reporting quality](https://github.com/TMSMultiLab/TMSMultiLab/wiki/Reporting-quality) of TMS articles. Following up on the [Chipchase et al (2012) questionnaire](https://github.com/TMSMultiLab/TMSMultiLab/wiki/Reporting-checklist).

This project requires additional co-authors to help rate the reporting quality of TMS papers, to help develop the tools and analysis code, and to contribute to manuscript writing and publishing. For more details, see the above two pages, and request membership of the [Quality Rating](https://github.com/orgs/TMSMultiLab/teams/quality_rating) team. Work will begin soon!

### 4. NEXT MEETING
The next two [meetings](https://github.com/TMSMultiLab/TMSMultiLab/wiki/Meetings) will focus on the [TMS@40 Workshop](https://github.com/TMSMultiLab/TMSMultiLab/wiki/TMS@40) - funded by the [Experimental Psychology Society](https://eps.ac.uk/) - how to organise the meetings, what should we discuss, how will we reach broad consensuses..?

### 5. ADMIN / ANY OTHER BUSINESS
Nick will write-up the notes and post to github. (You are reading them.)

We may need a co-host (and note-taker!) for future meetings. This could be done live on a page like this.
